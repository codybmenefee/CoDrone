## üéØ **Your Development Approach**

You've built an excellent foundation with a modular, AI-first architecture. Here's how to leverage your existing agentic development framework to build the conversational photogrammetry copilot MVP:

## üèóÔ∏è **Current Foundation Analysis**

### **‚úÖ What You Have (Excellent Foundation)**

- **Agentic Development Framework**: Ready for background agent delegation
- **Tool Registry Pattern**: Extensible tool system with decorators
- **Modern UI**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **File Upload System**: Multi-modal input handling
- **Session Management**: Conversation memory and persistence

### **üéØ What We're Building (MVP Vision)**

- **Conversational Photogrammetry**: Natural language ‚Üí real photogrammetry actions
- **Spatial Intelligence**: Volume measurement, area calculation, cut/fill analysis
- **Processing Orchestration**: ODM integration with async job management
- **Map Integration**: Interactive visualization with polygon drawing
- **Report Generation**: LLM-powered reports with measurements

## üöÄ **Development Strategy: Leveraging Your Agentic Framework**

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Core Tools (Weeks 1-2)**

#### Week 1: Setup & First Tools

##### Day 1-2: Environment Setup

```bash
# Run the MVP setup script
./scripts/setup-mvp.sh

# This will:
# - Install spatial libraries (GDAL, NumPy, GeoPandas)
# - Set up ODM Docker integration
# - Create MVP tool structure
# - Add map libraries (Leaflet, Turf.js)
```

##### Day 3-4: Volume Measurement Tool

```bash
# Delegate to background agent using your framework
make agent-context-mvp TASK="volume-measurement-tool"
# Edit .cursor/contexts/volume-measurement-tool.md with requirements
make agent-delegate-mvp CONTEXT="volume-measurement-tool" TASK="Implement volume calculation with polygon drawing"
```

##### Day 5-7: ODM Processing Tool

```bash
# Delegate ODM integration
make agent-context-mvp TASK="odm-processing-tool"
make agent-delegate-mvp CONTEXT="odm-processing-tool" TASK="Implement ODM job management with async processing"
```

#### Week 2: Integration & Advanced Tools

##### Day 8-10: Map Integration

- Delegate map component development
- Integrate Leaflet.js with polygon drawing
- Connect volume results to map visualization

##### Day 11-14: Report Generation

- Delegate report builder tool
- Implement LLM-powered report writing
- Add PDF generation with measurements

### **Phase 2: Spatial Intelligence (Weeks 3-4)**

#### **Week 3: Advanced Spatial Features**

- Cut/fill analysis between surveys
- Quality monitoring tools
- Change detection capabilities

#### **Week 4: Production Features**

- Error recovery and validation
- Performance optimization
- User experience polish

## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Use Your Agentic Development Framework**

### **1. Context Curation for Each Tool**

Your framework is perfect for this. For each tool, create detailed contexts:

```bash
# Example: Volume Measurement Tool
make agent-context-mvp TASK="volume-measurement-tool"
```

This creates `.cursor/contexts/volume-measurement-tool.md` with:

- Technical requirements (GDAL integration)
- User experience requirements (natural language commands)
- Integration points (map visualization)
- Testing strategy (unit tests for calculations)

### **2. Background Agent Delegation**

Delegate specific tool development:

```bash
# Delegate volume measurement tool
make agent-delegate-mvp CONTEXT="volume-measurement-tool" TASK="Implement volume calculation with polygon drawing"

# Delegate ODM processing tool
make agent-delegate-mvp CONTEXT="odm-processing-tool" TASK="Implement ODM job management with async processing"
```

### **3. Incremental Development**

Each tool is developed independently and integrated:

1. **Tool Development**: Background agent implements tool
2. **Integration**: Add to existing tool registry
3. **Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests
4. **UI Integration**: Connect to frontend components
5. **Documentation**: Update API docs and user guides

## üìã **Daily Development Workflow**

### **Morning Planning (30 min)**

```bash
# Review yesterday's progress
git log --oneline -10

# Plan today's agent tasks
make agent-context-mvp TASK="today-task-name"

# Update roadmap progress
# Edit .cursor/roadmaps/mvp-photogrammetry-roadmap.md
```

### **Agent Delegation (2-4 hours)**

```bash
# Delegate specific tool development
make agent-delegate-mvp CONTEXT="task-name" TASK="Implement specific feature"

# Monitor progress and provide feedback
# Review generated code and suggest improvements
```

### **Integration & Testing (1-2 hours)**

```bash
# Integrate new tools into main system
# Update tool registry
# Run tests
make mvp-test

# Update documentation
```

### **End-of-Day Review (30 min)**

```bash
# Update roadmap progress
# Plan next day's tasks
# Document any blockers
```

## üìä **Progress Tracking**

### **Roadmap Management**

```bash
# Update roadmap with progress
# Edit .cursor/roadmaps/mvp-photogrammetry-roadmap.md

# Track task status
# Use .cursor/tasks/ for individual task tracking
```

### **Quality Assurance**

```bash
# Run quality checks after agent work
make mvp-test

# Review agent-generated code
# Manual review of generated code

# Test agent implementations
# End-to-end testing of new features
```
