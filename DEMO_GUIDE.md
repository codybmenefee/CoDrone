**Test the weather service:**

```bash
# Test current weather
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/weather?lat=40.7128&lng=-74.0060&type=current"

# Test flight windows
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/weather?lat=40.7128&lng=-74.0060&type=flight-windows&duration=30"

# Test weather forecast
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/weather?lat=40.7128&lng=-74.0060&type=forecast&hours=24"
```

**Expected Results:**
- Current weather conditions with flight assessment
- Optimal flight windows ranked by safety
- 24-hour forecast with suitability ratings

**Frontend Test:**

### 2. Smart Boundary Detection

**Test AI boundary suggestions:**

```bash
# Get boundary suggestions for an area
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/boundary-suggestions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "centerLat": 40.7128,
    "centerLng": -74.0060,
    "radiusMeters": 1000,
    "options": {
      "missionType": "survey",

      }
    ],
    "session_id": "demo_session"
  }'
```

**Expected AI Response:**

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Integration Testing

### Mission Planner Interface

1. **Open http://localhost:3000**
2. **Navigate to Mission Planner** (if you have a route set up)
3. **Test Interactive Features:**

   ```typescript
   // Test the new components we built:
   // - MissionPlannerMap component
   // - MissionPlanningPanel component
   ```

   **Expected Interactions:**
   - Draw polygon on map
   - See flight path overlay automatically generated
   - Weather indicator shows current conditions
   - Mission parameters panel updates in real-time
   - Export button generates KML download

### Chat Interface Testing

1. **Open Chat Interface** at main page
2. **Test Mission Planning Commands:**

   ```
   User: "What are the weather conditions for flying at 40.7128, -74.0060?"

   User: "Plan a mapping mission for a construction site. The area is about 5 hectares and I need survey-grade accuracy."

   User: "Optimize flight parameters for inspection of a 50-meter tall building in 15 m/s winds."

   User: "Export the last flight plan for my DJI Mavic 3."
   ```

   **Expected AI Behaviors:**
   - Uses weather checking tools
   - Generates detailed mission plans
   - Provides optimization recommendations
   - Creates KML exports automatically

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Backend Issues

**If weather API fails:**
```bash
# Check if OpenWeather API key is set
echo $OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
# Add key to .env file if missing
```

**If spatial tools fail:**
```bash
# Check if GDAL is available
python -c "from osgeo import gdal; print('GDAL OK')"
# Should print "GDAL OK" or show fallback message
```

**If agent tools aren't loading:**
```bash
# Check tool registry
curl http://localhost:8000/tools
# Should list all mission planning tools
```

### Frontend Issues

**If map doesn't load:**
- Check browser console for Leaflet errors
- Ensure all CSS files are loading properly

**If components don't render:**
- Check that new TypeScript files compile without errors
- Verify import paths are correct
